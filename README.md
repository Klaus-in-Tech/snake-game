# Snake Game in Pygame

This is a simple Snake game built using Pygame library in Python. The game involves controlling a snake to eat food, and trying to score as many points as possible.

## Installation

To play this game, you need to have Python and Pygame installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/ 

To install Pygame, you can use pip, the package installer for Python. Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```sh
pip install pygame
```

## How to Play

To start the game, run the `snake-game.py` file using Python. You can use the arrow keys on your keyboard to control the snake's movement: up, down, left, or right. The snake will move continuously, and your goal is to eat the food that appears randomly on the screen.

If the snake hits the wall or its own body, the game will end.<br><br>
